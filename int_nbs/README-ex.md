I looked into the possible drivers of adoptability using Austin Animal Center's data accumulated from the past seven years. With a detailed eye, I prepped and explored my data in Jupyter Lab using Pandas, Seaborn and Mathplotlib. I then used Scikit-learn to create a logistic regression model used to predict the adoptability of a pet.

### Goal: 
The goal for this project is to create a model that will accurately predict if a pet will be adopted from Austin Animal Center and what features drive the prediction accuracy.

### Initial Hypotheses:

> Hypothesis₁
>
> There is a relationship between age and adoption.
    
> Hypothesis₂
>
> There is a relationship between breed and adoption.
    
> Hypothesis₃
>
> Dogs are adopted more than cats.
    
> Hypothesis₄
>
> There is a relationship between color and adoption.
    
### Project Planning Initial Thoughts:
**First iteration:**
I'd like my first iteration to include as many encoded features as possible for cats and dogs only. 

**Second iteration:**
I'd like to use takeaways from my exploration to cluster some features and use feature importance to remove features that aren't helping my model. 
- Cluster: 
    - age & breed
- New features:
    - age range/bin
    - encode animal type
    - binary encoded column of adoption
    - encode sex
        - include a feature of spayed/neutered
    - 

**Deliverables:**
- Final clean, interactive Py notebook.
- README.md
- Project summary

## Exploration Key Findings:
### Univariate
- 8% of outgoing pets are elderly
- 23% is full grown
- 68% are youngins
- more male than female 
- 69% are neutered
- 8% are pit/pit mix
- 9% black coats
- 51% dogs

### Bivariate
- pitbulls are getting adopted!
- although black coats are adopted at lower rates
- dogs have an advantage at adoption

### Multivariate
- adopted pets are usually younger
- males have a harder time getting adopted if older
- female pitbulls have a better chance of getting adopted 
- black coated females have a harder time getting adopted.

- More features *may* not drive model accuracy as much as anticipated.
- Logistic Regression is again a good model for predicting classification.
- Neutered status is the most important driver for adoption.

In order to get started reproducing this project, you'll need to setup a proper environment.

1. Begin by downloading the Austin Animal Center's data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jackdaoud/animal-shelter-analytics).
![aacbanner](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/96/6b/38/966b3864e78fa6ed1e728383a499a7d8.png)    

2. Recover your downloaded zip file and unzip.

**Prep your repo.**

3. Create a new repo to house this project, and clone it into your terminal by copying the SSH link:
    ![prep your repo](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d0/32/f0/d032f04aaafa14bcb65c675cc7ae828f.png)
> <code>git clone </code> (Cmd+V)
    

4. Create a `.gitignore` that includes any files you dont want shared on the internet and **push it**! 
    
    - (This can include your newly downloaded .csv files)
> <code>code .gitignore</code>



5. Create a `README.md` file to begin notating steps taken so far.
    
><code>code README.md</code>


6. Transfer your unzipped .csv files into your newly established folder.


7. Create a Jupyter Lab environment to continue working in.
> <code>jupyter lab</code>


8. Create Jupyter Notebook to begin the data pipeline.
